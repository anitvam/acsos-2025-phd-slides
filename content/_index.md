## Context: Autonomous Maritime Operations


* Maritime transport: 80% of world trade, growing automation.

* MASS (Maritime Autonomous Surface Ships): efficiency, safety, cost.

**Maybe add picture of trade report ?**

## Proposed Solution: Adaptive, decentralized relay schemes.
MST-based and cluster-based relays, aggregate programming, simulation validation.

Visual: the diagrams from the paper.

---


## Aggregate Programming: Concept
Macro-programming, computational fields, self-organization.
Visual:  field diagram.

## Baseline Relay Mechanism
Visual: The picture from paper.

## Distance-based Multi-Relay
Each vessel relays to the geographically closest station.
Visual: The picture from paper.

---

## Data Rate-based Multi-Relay
Relays chosen to maximize data rate, not just distance.
Visual: the picture from paper.
